# L-Systems
The turtle version parses the L-Systems using turtle as an interpreter and then every time a line is drawn in turtle the coordinates are saved and sent to plot.py which using matplotlib to plot them. This is super super super super inefficient and doing the vector calculations without the turtle wrapper is currently in the works
